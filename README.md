This is a procedurally generated calendar app that I wrote, the last time I worked on this was Dec, 2022.

The most recent updates are that I added a week view and a day view.  It mostly works but, the years that show up on the day view may not be correct when viewed.  I need to fix how that works.  I need to double check that week view checks for leap year as month view does.

I plan to add a back-end that lets a user create an account and save user data to each date, then access it in the different views.
